# LEEM
LEEM: Lean Elastic EM for Gaussian Mixture Model via Bounds-Based Filtering

LEEM is implemented based on the implementation of EM in OpenCV 3.4.1. Hence, to use LEEM, users need to replace the original files with these new files and compile OpenCV from source files. _test.cpp_ gives the sample program of how to use LEEM via OpenCV API.

More detailed instructions are coming soon.
